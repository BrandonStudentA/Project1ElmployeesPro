MVP: My Goal is to be able to search through the API and pull value that matches my input value by the employees first and last name,Having Lo-FI is understanding how the way the Employee Confirmation Tool will being used and by whom.

Post-MVP: Post MVP I would like to add Employee Confirmation Tool to a larger application that functions as an agencies HR software.
This would include building upon the current function and adding a hyperlink to the confirmed Employee linking to a broader Profile of Employee.
I would also embed the Employee Confirmation Tool to parent applications that have a broader scope of services. Employee Confirmation Tool will be one tool as part of an Agencies HR SoftWare Capabilities
