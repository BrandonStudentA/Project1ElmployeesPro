Description: This application is created as one small part of a post MVP Human Resource Software. As of now the implementations includes a function that looks to confirm an employee. 
Employee Confirmation Tool is meant for use by agencies HR dept and not for the general public use.The Employee Confirmation Tool is lo-fi by design as it will only have bare minimum usability. Employee Confirmation Tool is compatible for Desktop/Mobile/ Tablets!!

API: http://dummy.restapiexample.com/api/v1/employees
List of Name To Search For !
"Cedric Kelly"
"Colleen Hurst"
"Paul Byrd"


MVP: My Goal is to be able to search through the API and pull value that matches my input value by the employees first and last name,Having Lo-FI is understanding who the way the Employee Confirmation Tool is being used by.

Post-MVP: Post MVP I would like to add Employee Confirmation Tool to a larger application that functions as an agencies HR software.
This would include building upon the current function and adding a hyperlink to the confirmed Employee linking to a broader Profile of Employee.
I would also embed the Employee Confirmation Tool to parent applications that have a broader scope of services. Employee Confirmation Tool will be one tool as part of an Agencies HR SoftWare Capabilities
